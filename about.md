## About these pages

This is my almost-blog. I have no plans to write regularly. I just need
a place with minimalist design where I can post some notes
(mostly technical) that might be helpful to someone if I shared them
publicly. I am not looking for exposure nor self-promotion, nor do I
have any plans to become an influencer. I am too old for that shit.


## About me

I write code for work, I write code as a hobby.
I am an engineer, hacker, dad, husband, son, friend to
many, enemy to some, robotics mentor, community volunteer, tennis player,
soccer player, skier, former competitive rower, geek, and maybe a few
other things.

## Disclaimer

What is a public page without a mandatory disclaimer? Opinions stated
here are my own and not of my employer. I speak for my self and only myself.
